## Introduction

Who is the UFC G.O.A.T.? Some argue it's Jon Jones, others say it's GSP, or even Mighty Mouse. In this project I attempt to answer this question more objectively by applying the Glicko-2 rating algorithm. Using fight results from the UFCâ€™s modern era, I apply Glicko-2 to rate fighters based solely on their UFC performances.

Glicko-2 is a rating algorithm developed by [Dr. Mark Glickman](https://www.glicko.net/index.html) as an improvement to the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). Both systems work by assessing two-player games and adjusting each player's rating based on the result. The most well-known application of Glicko is in online chess platforms ([see Chess.com](https://support.chess.com/en/articles/8566476-how-do-ratings-work-on-chess-com)), but it is also a powerful tool for evaluating competitors in any one-on-one sport. Here we implement the algorithm to rate UFC fighters to identify the most skillful competitors.

The benefit of using Glicko-2 over traditional rating systems (like Elo) is that Glicko-2 accounts for uncertainty in ratings. Specifically, Glicko-2 takes a Bayesian approach by modeling player skill as a probability distribution (instead of a single value). This is a critical feature that makes Glicko-2 a great choice for computing ratings in the UFC, where upsets and evolving skill sets make it difficult to assign static ratings.
